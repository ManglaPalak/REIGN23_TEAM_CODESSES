# REIGN23_TEAM_CODESSES

This is a HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM project made using PYTHON nad its libraries MYSQL.CONNECTOR and TKINTER. MYSQL is used to store data in tabular or organised form.
To run this program all the 3 python code files namely  main_code , pharmacy and patient_and_doctor_record  are to be saved in a single folder.
The main_code as the name suggests is the code which will be running and giving us the output and the other code files pharmacy and patient_and_doctor_record works as 
python libraries which are called in the main_code program.
In this program we are having 3 windows: PHARMACY window, PATIENT RECORD window and DOCTOR RECORD window. In each window we have many buttons to add, delete, create
prescriptions, clear and exit the window. In this the user can input data in the entry boxes according to the name of the field written. The data input by the user
will be saved in the MYSQL tables and will also be shown in tabular form on the same window also.
For PATIENT RECORD window, on adding the data and clicking on the 'SAVE PRESCRIPTION DATA' button the data will be saved in the table and a user-friendly messagebox 
will pop-up which tells us that the record has been added and the prescription for the patient will be generated on clicking the 'PRESCRIPTION' button.
On clicking on a record in the below table and clicking the 'DELETE' button, the data will be deleted from the table and a messagebox will pop-up telling the user that
the record has been deleted. And for the 'CLEAR' button, the content in the entry boxes will be cleared so that new set of data could be entered. Finally the 'EXIT' 
button, on clicking the button a messagebox will be shown to confirm that the user wants to exit the window. On clicking 'YES' the window will be closed while on 
clicking 'NO' the window will continue to function and no difference it will make.
These buttons are also present in the PHARMACY and DOCTOR RECORD windows.
